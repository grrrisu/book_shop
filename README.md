## EventStorming Diagram

The diagram follows Event Storming conventions with color coding:

- **ðŸŸ  Orange**: Domain Events (the key business events that happen)
- **ðŸ“˜ Blue**: Commands (actions that trigger events)
- **ðŸŸ¡ Yellow**: Aggregates/Bounded Contexts (your GenServer modules)
- **ðŸ“— Green**: Read Models/Views (data projections)
- **ðŸŸ£ Purple**: Policies/Business Rules (reactive behaviors)
- **ðŸ‘¤ Pink**: Actors/Personas (users and external systems)

The diagram shows the complete reactive flow:

1. **Customer Journey**: Customer buys books â†’ order placed â†’ books shipped â†’ payment â†’ newsletter â†’ repeat
2. **Inventory Management**: Auto-reordering when stock is low
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All components react to events via PubSub
4. **Business Policies**: Tax calculation, inventory checks, periodic newsletters
